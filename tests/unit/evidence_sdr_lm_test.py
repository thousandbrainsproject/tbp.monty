        In this unit test, we train 3 SDRs, then train a 4th SDR. Therefore,
        the stability will be applied on the 3 trained SDRs. We save a copy
        of those 3 SDRs before training the 4th SDR (before_sdrs), and compare
        it to the 3 SDRs after training the 4th SDR (after_sdrs). Depending on

        overlap (i.e., 41). But if they changed we get less that 41 overlap
