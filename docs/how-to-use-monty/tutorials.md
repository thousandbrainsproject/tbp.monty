These tutorials will help you get familiar with Monty. Topics and experiments increase in complexity as the tutorials progress, so we recommend going through them in order. You can also learn about contributing tutorials [here](../contributing/contributing-tutorials.md).
- [Running Your First Experiment](tutorials/running-your-first-experiment.md): Demonstrates basic layout of an experiment config and outlines experimental training loops.
- [Pretraining a Model](tutorials/pretraining-a-model.md): Shows how to configure an experiment for supervised pretraining.
- [Running Inference with a Pretrained Model](tutorials/running-inference-with-a-pretrained-model.md): Demonstrates how to load a pretrained model and use it to perform object and pose recognition.
- [Unsupervised Continual Learning](tutorials/unsupervised-continual-learning.md): Demonstrates how to use Monty for unsupervised continual learning to learn new objects from scratch.
- [Multiple Learning Modules](tutorials/multiple-learning-modules.md): Show how to perform pretraining and inference using multiple sensor modules and multiple learning modules.
