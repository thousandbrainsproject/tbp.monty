title: Running Inference with a Pretrained Model
---
# Introduction

This tutorial is a follow-up of our tutorial on [pretraining a model](pretraining-a-model.md). Here we will load the pretraining data into model and perform object recognition under noisy conditions and under several arbitrary object rotations.

> [!NOTE]
> The [first part](pretraining-a-model.md) of this tutorial must be completed for the code in this tutorial to run.

# Setting up the Experiment Config for Inference
To follow along, create a new file called `pretraining_tutorial_eval.py` in the `benchmarks/configs/` folder and paste the code snippets into it.

```python
import os

import numpy as np

from tbp.monty.frameworks.config_utils.config_args import (
    EvalLoggingConfig,
    MontyArgs,
    MotorSystemConfigCurInformedSurfaceGoalStateDriven,
    PatchAndViewSOTAMontyConfig,
)
from tbp.monty.frameworks.config_utils.make_dataset_configs import (
    EnvironmentDataloaderPerObjectArgs,
    EvalExperimentArgs,
    PredefinedObjectInitializer,
    SurfaceViewFinderMountHabitatDatasetArgs,
)
from tbp.monty.frameworks.environments import embodied_data as ED
from tbp.monty.frameworks.experiments import (
    MontyObjectRecognitionExperiment,
)
from tbp.monty.frameworks.models.evidence_matching import EvidenceGraphLM
from tbp.monty.frameworks.models.goal_state_generation import (
    EvidenceGoalStateGenerator,
)
from tbp.monty.frameworks.models.sensor_modules import (
    DetailedLoggingSM,
    FeatureChangeSM,
)

"""
Basic setup
-----------
"""
# Specify directory where an output directory will be created.
project_dir = os.path.expanduser("~/tbp/results/monty/projects")

# Specify the model name. This needs to be the same name as used for pretraining.
model_name = "surf_agent_1lm_2obj"

# Where to find the pretrained model.
model_path = os.path.join(project_dir, model_name, "pretrained")

# Where to save eval logs.
output_dir = os.path.join(project_dir, model_name)
run_name = "eval"
```
Now we specify that we want to test the model on "mug" and "banana", and that we want the objects to be rotated a few different ways.
```python
# Specify object to test and the rotations in which they should be tested.
object_names = ["mug", "banana"]
test_rotations = [
    np.array([0.0, 15.0, 30.0]),
    np.array([7.0, 77.0, 2.0]),
    np.array([81.0, 33.0, 90.0]),
]
```
Since this config is going to be a bit more complex, we will build it up in pieces. Here is the configuration for sensor modules.
```python
# Let's add some noise to the sensor module outputs to make the task more challenging.
sensor_noise_params = dict(
    features=dict(
        pose_vectors=2,  # rotate by random degrees along xyz
        hsv=np.array([0.1, 0.2, 0.2]),  # add noise to each channel (the values here specify std. deviation of gaussian for each channel individually)
        principal_curvatures_log=0.1,
        pose_fully_defined=0.01,  # flip bool in 1% of cases
    ),
    location=0.002,  # add gaussian noise with 0.002 std (0.2cm)
)

sensor_module_0 = dict(
    sensor_module_class=FeatureChangeSM,
    sensor_module_args=dict(
        sensor_module_id="patch",
        # Features that will be extracted and sent to LM
        # note: don't have to be all the features extracted during pretraining.
        features=[
            "pose_vectors",
            "pose_fully_defined",
            "on_object",
            "object_coverage",
            "min_depth",
            "mean_depth",
            "hsv",
            "principal_curvatures",
            "principal_curvatures_log",
        ],
        save_raw_obs=False,
        # FeatureChangeSM will only send an observation to the LM if features or location
        # changed more than these amounts.
        delta_thresholds={
            "on_object": 0,
            "n_steps": 20,
            "hsv": [0.1, 0.1, 0.1],
            "pose_vectors": [np.pi / 4, np.pi * 2, np.pi * 2],
            "principal_curvatures_log": [2, 2],
            "distance": 0.01,
        },
        surf_agent_sm=True,  # for surface agent
        noise_params=sensor_noise_params,
    ),
)
sensor_module_1 = dict(
    sensor_module_class=DetailedLoggingSM,
    sensor_module_args=dict(
        sensor_module_id="view_finder",
        save_raw_obs=False,
    ),
)
sensor_module_configs = dict(
    sensor_module_0=sensor_module_0,
    sensor_module_1=sensor_module_1,
)
```
There are two main differences between this config and the pretraining sensor module config. First, we are adding some noise to the sensor patch, so we define noise parameters and add them to `sensory_module_0`'s dictionary. Second, we're using the `FeatureChangeSM` class instead of `HabitatSurfacePatchSM`. `FeatureChangeSM` is more efficient when graph matching since it only sends an observation to the learning module if the features have changed significantly. Note that `FeatureChangeSM` can be used with either a surface or distant agent, for which `surf_agent_sm` should be appropriately set.

For the learning module, we specify

```python
# Tolerances within which features must match stored values in order to add evidence
# to a hypothesis.
tolerances = {
    "patch": {
        "hsv": np.array([0.1, 0.2, 0.2]),
        "principal_curvatures_log": np.ones(2),
    }
}

# Features where weight is not specified default weight to 1.
feature_weights = {
    "patch": {
        # Weighting saturation and value less since these might change under different
        # lighting conditions.
        "hsv": np.array([1, 0.5, 0.5]),
    }
}

learning_module_0 = dict(
    learning_module_class=EvidenceGraphLM,
    learning_module_args=dict(
        # Search the model in a radius of 1cm from the hypothesized location on the model.
        max_match_distance=0.01,  # =1cm
        tolerances=tolerances,
        feature_weights=feature_weights,
        # Most likely hypothesis needs to have 20% more evidence than the others to be considered
        # certain enough to trigger a terminal condition (match).
        x_percent_threshold=20,
        # Look at features associated with (at most) the 10 closest learned points.
        max_nneighbors=10,
        # Update all hypotheses with evidence > x_percent_threshold (faster)
        evidence_update_threshold="x_percent_threshold",
        # Config for goal state generator of LM which is used for model-based action suggestions,
        # such as hypothesis-testing actions.
        gsg_class=EvidenceGoalStateGenerator,
        gsg_args=dict(
            # Tolerance(s) when determining goal-state success
            goal_tolerances=dict(
                location=0.015,  # distance in meters
            ),
            # Number of necessary steps for a hypothesis-testing action to be considered
            min_post_goal_success_steps=5,
        ),
    ),
)
learning_module_configs = dict(learning_module_0=learning_module_0)
```

Since this learning module will be performing graph matching, we want to specify further parameters that will define various thresholds and weights to be given to different features. We're also using the `EvidenceGraphLM` rather than the `GraphLM` which keeps a continuous evidence count for all its hypotheses and is currently the best-performing LM in this codebase.

We then integrate these sensor and learning module configs into the overall experiment config.

```python
# The config dictionary for the evaluation experiment.
surf_agent_2obj_eval = dict(
    # Set up experiment
    experiment_class=MontyObjectRecognitionExperiment,
    experiment_args=EvalExperimentArgs(
        model_name_or_path=model_path,  # load the pre-trained models from this path
        n_eval_epochs=len(test_rotations),
        max_total_steps=5000,
    ),
    logging_config=EvalLoggingConfig(
        output_dir=output_dir,
        run_name=run_name,
        wandb_handlers=[],  # remove this line if you, additionally, want to log to WandB.
    ),
    # Set up monty, including LM, SM, and motor system.
    monty_config=PatchAndViewSOTAMontyConfig(
        monty_args=MontyArgs(min_eval_steps=20),
        sensor_module_configs=sensor_module_configs,
        learning_module_configs=learning_module_configs,
        motor_system_config=MotorSystemConfigCurInformedSurfaceGoalStateDriven(),
    ),
    # Set up environment/data
    dataset_class=ED.EnvironmentDataset,
    dataset_args=SurfaceViewFinderMountHabitatDatasetArgs(),
    eval_dataloader_class=ED.InformedEnvironmentDataLoader,
    eval_dataloader_args=EnvironmentDataloaderPerObjectArgs(
        object_names=object_names,
        object_init_sampler=PredefinedObjectInitializer(rotations=test_rotations),
    ),
    # Doesn't get used, but currently needs to be set anyways.
    train_dataloader_class=ED.InformedEnvironmentDataLoader,
    train_dataloader_args=EnvironmentDataloaderPerObjectArgs(
        object_names=object_names,
        object_init_sampler=PredefinedObjectInitializer(rotations=test_rotations),
    ),
)
```

Note that we have changed the Monty experiment class and the logging config. We also opted for a policy whereby learning-modules generate actions to test hypotheses by producing "goal-states" for the low-level motor system (`MotorSystemConfigCurInformedSurfaceGoalStateDriven`). Additionally, we are now initializing the objects at `test_rotations` instead of `train_rotations`.

Finally, add the following lines to the bottom of the file:

```python
CONFIGS = dict(
    surf_agent_2obj_eval=surf_agent_2obj_eval,
)
```
Next, you will need to add the following lines to the `benchmarks/configs/__init__.py` file:

```python
from .pretraining_tutorial_eval import CONFIGS as PRETRAINING_TUTORIAL_EVAL

# Put this line after CONFIGS is initialized
CONFIGS.update(PRETRAINING_TUTORIAL_EVAL)
```

# Running the Experiment

To run the experiment, navigate to the `benchmarks/` folder and call the `run.py` script with an experiment name as the -e argument.

```shell
cd benchmarks
python run.py -e surf_agent_2obj_eval
```
Once the run is complete, you can inspect the inference logs located in `~/tbp/results/monty/projects/surf_agent_1lm_2obj/eval`. Since `EvalLoggingConfig` includes a CSV-logger, you should be able to open `eval_stats.csv` and find 6 rows (one for each episode) detailing whether the object was correctly identified, the number of steps required in an episode, etc.
