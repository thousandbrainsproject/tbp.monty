title: Using Monty in a Custom Application
---
# Introduction


## What Kind of Applications can Monty be Used for?

## Things you Need to Define
- Explain what to think through and what things to define (movement/actions, observations, pose, episode, epoch, labels/training)

## Example 1: Monty Meets World
- Images of MMW example
- Explain how we define all the things listed above

## Example 2: Omniglot
- Images of Omniglot
- Explain how we define all the things listed above

# Customizing Monty for Your Application
- Class diagram overview with those to customize highlighted

## Example 1: Monty Meets World
- Explain which custom classes to implement, using MontyMeetsWorld benchmarks as example
- Class diagram of custom mmw classes

## Example 2: Omniglot
- same structure as above

## Custom Environment, Dataset and Dataloader

## Custom Sensor Module

## Custom Motor System

## Specifying the Experiment Config
- Use monty meets world benchmarks for this
- Add reference box to how to download mmw dataset & pretrained models

# Conclusion
