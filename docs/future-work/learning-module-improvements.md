title: Learning Module Improvements
description: Improvements we would like to add to the learning modules.
---
We have a guide on [customizing learning modules](learning-module-improvements/contributing-learning-modules) here.

These are the things we would like to implement:

- [Use off-object observations](learning-module-improvements/use-off-object-observations.md) #numsteps #multiobj
- [Reinitialize hypotheses when starting to recognize a new object](learning-module-improvements/reinitialize-hypotheses-when-starting-to-recognize-a-new-object.md) #multiobj
- [Improve bounded evidence performance](learning-module-improvements/improve-bounded-evidence-performance.md) #multiobj
- [Use models with less points](learning-module-improvements/use-models-with-less-points.md) #speed #generalization
- [Make it possible to store multiple feature maps on one graph](learning-module-improvements/make-it-possible-to-store-multiple-feature-maps-on-one-graph.md) #featsandmorph
- [Test particle-filter-like resampling of hypothesis space](learning-module-improvements/test-particle-filter-like-resampling-of-hypothesis-space.md) #accuracy #speed
- [Re-anchor hypotheses](learning-module-improvements/re-anchor-hypotheses.md) #deformations #noise #generalization
- [Less dependency on first observation](learning-module-improvements/less-dependency-on-first-observation.md) #noise #multiobj
- [Deal with incomplete models](learning-module-improvements/deal-with-incomplete-models.md) #learning
- [Implement & test GNNs to model object behaviors & states](learning-module-improvements/implement-test-gnns-to-model-object-behaviors-states.md) #dynamic
- [Deal with moving objects](learning-module-improvements/deal-with-moving-objects.md) #dynamic #realworld

Please see the [instructions here](project-roadmap.md#how-you-can-contribute) if you would like to tackle one of these tasks.
