title: Use Models with Fewer Points
---

This task relates to the on-going implementation of hierarchically arranged LMs. As these become available, it should become possible to decompose objects into simpler sub-object components, which in turn will enable LMs to model objects with significantly fewer points than the ~2,000 per object currently used.
