## Platform Current Reality Tree

For an overview of all existing Undesirable Effects, you can consult [the Platform Current Reality Tree artifact](https://link.excalidraw.com/readonly/wtdsu2JWW5qINtJpQJ1O). For an explanation of what it is and how to use it, see [the Platform Current Reality Tree Discourse post](https://thousandbrains.discourse.group/t/platform-current-reality-tree/776).

## Platform Future Reality Tree

Similarly, for an overview of all upcoming planned work and what Desired Effects we would like to achieve, you can consult [the Platform Future Reality Tree artifact](https://link.excalidraw.com/readonly/1zkoPDpkfKlbyGfCaLsY). It is similar to the Platform Current Reality Tree, but includes Injections, that change the current reality into a future reality. A more elaborate explanation, of what a Platform Future Reality Tree is and how to use it, is forthcoming.

## Proposed Improvements

We track proposed improvements in terms of Injections that change the current reality into a future, more desirable, reality. The following is a list of Injections corresponding to the so far identified Desired Effects.

- [Injection #9: Integrate a second simulator that runs Python >= 3.8](platform-improvements/injection-9-integrate-a-second-simulator-that-runs-python-38.md)
- [Injection #16: Integrate a second simulator that runs on CPU.](platform-improvements/injection-16-integrate-a-second-simulator-that-runs-on-cpu.md)
- [Injection #17: Integrate a second simulator that runs on Windows.](platform-improvements/injection-17-integrate-a-second-simulator-that-runs-on-windows.md)
- [Injection #19: Integrate a second simulator that does not require conda.](platform-improvements/injection-19-integrate-a-second-simulator-that-does-not-require-conda.md)
