## Process

1. Collect forum questions from thousandbrains.discourse.group into a spreadsheet
2. Analyze the questions to identify common themes and patterns
3. Identify which themes indicate documentation gaps or unclear areas
4. Create or improve documentation to address these gaps
5. Link back to the improved documentation in forum responses

## Expected Outcomes

- Spreadsheet with categorized forum questions and identified themes
- Improved documentation addressing common questions
- Better user experience as common questions are answered in docs
- Reduced repetitive questions in the forum
