We’d like to produce shorter, more accessible videos that introduce the Thousand Brains Project. Our current YouTube “Quickstart” playlist runs about seven and a half hours and, while comprehensive, is dense and difficult to digest. The goal is to make this material easier to follow without losing essential information.

**Example directions this could take:**
- A more condensed series of quick-start videos, each covering a core concept of the project.
- Videos comparing this project and Monty to specific AI fields:
  - Reinforcement Learning
  - Deep Learning
  - SLAM
- **Core Idea Animations** — short, visual explainers illustrating one key concept per episode.
- **Community Projects** — videos showcasing projects built with Monty.

A polished example is Artem Kirsanov’s [**Cortical Columns**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dykkubb-Qus) video, which effectively conveys a core concept of the project.
