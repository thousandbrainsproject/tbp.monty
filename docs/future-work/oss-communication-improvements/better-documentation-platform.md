The current platform for documentation is readme.com.  It has a number of drawbacks:
- Doesn't support preview versions unless you have an account with them.  We want preview versions to be available to everyone in the community, but hidden from the main documentation navigation.
- Doesn't support custom markdown plugins â€” notably we'd like to extend our documentation to support other display types:
  - LaTeX support
  - Mermaid
  - Jupyter notebooks
  - JavaScript integration
  - etc...
- The display format is limited in size.
- Doesn't allow complete control over theming.
- Doesn't provide UX control over the navigation, menus, etc.
- Local development support.

We are open to new platform suggestions, but our initial research suggests that a homegrown solution would be the best fit and more extensible for our future needs.

A proof of concept was created by modifying the `github_readme_sync` tool and can be viewed here:

# Requirements

## Core Platform
- Versioned doc releases that match our code (major.minor).
- Atomic deploys from our GitHub repository.
- Preview versions that are hidden from the main documentation navigation.
- Permanent links to specific documents / versioned documents.
- Source documents in markdown.
- If its not homegrown, it should have API access to sync the content from a GitHub action.
- Local development support.

## Content and Presentation
- Code blocks.
- Images.
- Inline videos.
- Complete control over theming.
- Complete control over the navigation, menus, etc.
- Left hand navigation.
- Responsive layouts for mobile, tablet, and desktop.
- Header and footer branding.

## Navigation and Linking
- Deep linking.
- Redirects for deleted or renamed documents.
- Redirects for legacy URLs.
- SEO friendly slugs.
- Social media sharing using Open Graph tags.

## Search and Analytics
- Search.
- Integration with Google Analytics.

## Glossary Integration
- Automatic identification of glossary terms from `docs/overview/glossary.md` in all markdown files
- Subtle hover tooltips displaying glossary definitions when users hover over terms
- This feature may require the new platform as readme.com may not support the necessary markdown extensions or JavaScript integration
