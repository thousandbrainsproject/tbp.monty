Identify university departments that might be interested in learning about the Thousand Brains Theory and Project, with a focus on arranging guest lecture opportunities for TBP researchers to present their work.

## Target Departments

Focus on departments in the following areas:
- Neuroscience
- Computational neuroscience
- Reinforcement learning
- SLAM (Simultaneous Localization and Mapping)
- Computer science

## Academic Level

Preferably target programs at the Masters and PhD level, as these students and faculty are most likely to engage deeply with the current theoretical and research aspects of the Thousand Brains Project.

## Geographic Scope

No geographic preference - consider universities worldwide that align with the target departments and academic levels.

## Engagement Format

Primary focus: **Guest lecture spots** where Thousand Brains Project researchers can present their work to students and faculty. These presentations would cover:
- The Thousand Brains Theory
- The Monty implementation
- Research findings and applications
- Opportunities for collaboration

## Expected Outcomes

- Introductions for our researcher to interested university departments and programs.
