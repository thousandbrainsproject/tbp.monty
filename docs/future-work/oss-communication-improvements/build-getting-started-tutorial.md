Create a tutorial walking through the steps to getting started with Monty from your perspective with your specific setup. The tutorial should document the experience of setting up and running Monty on a supported platform.

## Format Options

The tutorial can be created in either format:
- YouTube video
- Blog post

Both formats may potentially become core documentation if they add value to the existing getting started guides.


## Content Areas

The tutorial should cover the complete getting started experience:
- Forking and cloning the repository
- Setting up the conda environment
- Running tests
- Running an experiment
- Any platform-specific considerations or challenges encountered
- Building an experiment config
- Adding a sensor module

The tutorial should reflect the actual experience, including any troubleshooting or issues encountered during setup, as this can be valuable for others following the same path.
