title: Pull Request Flow

![Blue: Contributor responsibility  <br>Gray: Maintainer responsibility](../../figures/contributing/pull_request_flow.png)


The Pull Request flow begins when you **Create a Pull Request** to our [GitHub repository](https://github.com/thousandbrainsproject/tbp.monty/pulls).

# 1. Triage

A **Maintainer** will check the Pull Request for validity. If it is invalid, it will be **Rejected**. The **Maintainer** should include an explanation for why the Pull Request has been rejected.

A valid Pull Request is on-topic, well-formatted, and contains expected information.

A **Maintainer** will apply the appropriate labels (`triaged` at a minimum) as part of **[Triage](../guides-for-maintainers/triage.md#pull-request-triage)**.

A **Maintainer** may also assign the Pull Request to one or more **Maintainers** for **Review** by adding them to the "Assignees" list.

> [!NOTE]
> **Maintainers**
>
> When assigning the Pull Request for **Review**, please keep in mind that _all assigned_ **Maintainers** must **Approve** the Pull Request before it can be **Merged**.
>
> Use the "Assignees" list to assign the Pull Request to a **Maintainer**. The "Reviewers" list may include others that contributed to reviewing the Pull Request.

## Reject

If your Pull Request has been **Rejected** and you want to resubmit it, you should start over and **Create a new Pull Request** with appropriate changes. Depending on the reason for rejection, it might be good to [submit an RFC](../request-for-comments-rfc.md) first.

# 2. Review and Request Changes

Automated checks run against the Pull Request as part of the **Review**. If the automated checks fail, you should **Update the Pull Request**.

If all automated checks pass, **Maintainers** will **Review** the Pull Request. If changes are needed, **Maintainers** will **Request Changes**.

# 3. Update Pull Request

If automated checks fail or **Maintainers** **Request Changes**, you are responsible for **Updating the Pull Request**. Once you updated, the Pull Request will again enter **Review**.

# 4. Approve

Once all assigned **Maintainers** (listed in the "Assignees" list) **Approve** your Pull Request, your Pull Request is eligible to be **Merged**.

If the automated checks fail while your Pull Request is **Approved**, it is your responsibility to **Update the Pull Request**.

**Maintainers** may delay **Merging** your Pull Request to accommodate any optional commits implementing non-blocking suggestions from the **Review** (these are depicted as **Suggested Commits** in the flow diagram).

Once your Pull Request is **Approved**, if you make any unexpected commits that do not implement non-blocking suggestions from the **Review** (these are depicted as **Unexpected Commits** in the flow diagram), **Maintainers** may **Withdraw Approval** and the Pull Request will need to be **Reviewed** again.

> [!CAUTION]
> _**Maintainers**_
>
> _The reason for you to **Withdraw Approval** would be to communicate the need for additional **Review** after unexpected changes. If you do not **Withdraw Approval**, other **Maintainers** may interpret the Pull Request as **Approved** and merge it._

# 5. Merge

> [!CAUTION]
> _**Maintainers**_
>
> _All assigned **Maintainers** must **Approve** the Pull Request before it can be **Merged**._
>
> _As of this writing (October 2024), GitHub does not provide a mechanism to enforce this._

**Maintainers** will **Merge** your **Approved** Pull Request.

After **Merge**, automated post-merge checks and tasks will run. If these fail, the Pull Request will be **Reverted**. If they succeed, you are **Done** ðŸ¥³ðŸŽ‰ðŸŽŠ.

## Revert

If your Pull Request is **Reverted**, you should start over and **Create Pull Request** with the appropriate changes.
