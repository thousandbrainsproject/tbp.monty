# Overview

Our documentation is held in markdown files in the Monty repo under the [`/docs` folder](../../docs/). This documentation is synchronized to readme.com for viewing whenever a change is made. The order of sections, documents, and subdocuments is maintained by a hierarchy file called `/docs/hierarchy.md`. This is a fairly straightforward markdown document that is used to tell readme how to order the categories, documents and sub-documents.

> üìò Edits to the documentation need to be submitted in the form of PRs to the Monty repository.


# Relative Links

Links to other documents should use the standard markdown link syntax, and should be relative to the documents location.

```markdown
relative link in the same directory
[Link Text](placeholder-example-doc.md)

a relative link, with a deep-link to a heading
[Link Text](../contributing/placeholder-example-doc.md#relative-links)
```

These links will work even if you're on a designated version of the documentation.

# Modifying a Document or Sub-Document

This is the simplest flow.  To modify a document simply edit the markdown file in your forked version of the monty repository and commit the changes by following the normal [Pull Requests](pull-requests.md) process.

# Creating a Document

To create a new document, create the new file in the category directory, then add a corresponding line in the `/docs/hierarchy.md` file.

```markdown Markdown
# my-category: My Category
- [my-new-doc](/my-category/new-placeholder-example-doc.md)
- [some-existing-doc](/my-category/placeholder-example-doc.md)
```

Then, create your markdown document `/docs/my-category/new-placeholder-example-doc.md` and add the appropriate Frontmatter.

```markdown
---
title: 'New Placeholder Example Doc'
---
# My first heading
```

> üöß Quotes
>
>Please put the title in single quotes and, if applicable, escape any single quotes using two single quotes in a row.
Exapmle: `title: 'My New Doc''s'`

> üöß Your title must match the url-safe slug
>
>So if your title is `My New Doc's` then your file name should be `my-new-docs.md`

Continue with the [Pull Requests](pull-requests.md) process.

## Creating Sub-Documents

Documents that are nested under other documents require that you create a folder with the same name as the parent document but without the `.md` extension.  Then, you place any sub-documents in that folder.  For example, if you were creating a document called `new-placeholder-example-doc.md` beneath the document `Category One/some-existing-doc.md` file you would create a folder called `category-one/some-existing-doc` and place the new document in that folder.


And then update the `hierarchy.md` file

```markdown markdown
# category-one: Category One
- [some-existing-doc](category-one/some-existing-doc.md)
  - [new-doc](category-one/some-existing-doc/new-placeholder-example-doc.md)

# category-two: Category Two
...
```

Continue with the [Pull Requests](pull-requests.md) process.

# Reordering a Document

If the move is within a category or sub-pages within a page, you can simply edit the `hierarchy.md` file and update the locations by moving the lines around.

If you are changing the parent path of a document (ie, sub-page -> page, or page -> sub-page, or page/sub-page -> new category, or sub-page -> new page, then along with updating the `hierarchy.md` file you also must update the folder structure to make sure the document is correctly located.  The sync tool will fail with a pre-check error saying there is a mismatch between the hierarchy file and the location on disk if they do not match up.

Continue with the [Pull Requests](pull-requests.md) process.

> üöß You cannot reorder categories as the readme.com API does not support this.
>
> Changes to the category order should be done in the readme.com UI and reflected in the `hierarchy.md` file.

# Deleting or Renaming a Document

If a document is well established (it has been around for more than 6 months), people may be using permalinks to it. Therefore, it is a good idea to create a redirect file rather than deleting or renaming it. To do this, set the document to hidden with a relocation link to a relevant area or new document location. Hidden files are reachable from the URL, just not shown in the navigation.

```markdown
---
title: 'Badly Named Doc'
hidden: true
---
>  ‚ö†Ô∏è this document has moved to <insert link>
```

Continue with the usual [Pull Requests](pull-requests.md) process.

# Creating a New Top-Level Category

To create a new category, simply create a new folder inside the `/docs` folder and add a reference to it in the `hierarchy.md` file.  Categories in the hierarchy file need a slug and title separated by a colon.

```markdown markdown
# category-one: Category One

# category-two: Category Two
```

# Checking Links

In our documentation sync tool there is a flag to check internal links, image references and hierarchy file references.  This is a good way to ensure that all links are working correctly before submitting a PR.

To check the links, [activate the conda environment](../how-to-use-monty/getting-started.md#miniconda), and then run the following command:

``` 
python -m tools.github_readme_sync.cli check docs
```

# Images

See the [Style Guide](style-guide.md#images) images section for details about creating and referencing images correctly.

# VS Code Snippets

> üëç You have access to VS Code snippets

When you checkout the repository, you have access to markdown snippets for tables, code blocks, warnings and more.  While your cursor is in a markdown file, press `CMD + Shift + P` and select `Insert snippet` to select a desired documentation snippet.

# Versioning

The Monty documentation uses the first two parts of semantic versioning (semver), as there is nothing to document for patch changes.  You can read about semver here <https://semver.org/>.
