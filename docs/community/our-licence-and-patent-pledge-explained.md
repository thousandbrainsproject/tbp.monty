title: Our Licence and Patent Pledge Explained
---
# Overview

One of the goals of the Thousand Brains Project is to create a new form of AI that benefits the world **to the greatest extent possible**. To accomplish this goal of broad adoption, we have chosen a **permissive license** and Numenta has created a **non-assertion pledge** that covers the patents related to the Thousand Brains Project. These two actions, we believe, will encourage researchers, universities, the private sector, and industry specialists to help accelerate our community's progress in building impressive new capabilities to serve the world.

# üõ°Ô∏è License

We have chosen the standard [MIT License](https://github.com/thousandbrainsproject/tbp.monty/blob/main/LICENSE). This permissive license places few restrictions on reuse and permits commercial use. It is simple, concise, and compatible with many other licenses.

# ‚öñÔ∏è Patent Non-assertion Pledge

Numenta holds several patents that were created as we unraveled the complexities of the human neocortex and how these principles can be applied to machine learning. However, Numenta's non-assertion pledge means we will only assert these patents defensively to protect the open-source community.  You are free to use all of the technology in the open-source project to create value without worrying about Numenta's patents.
