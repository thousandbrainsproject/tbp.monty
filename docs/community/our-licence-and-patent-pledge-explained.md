title: Our Licence and Patent Pledge Explained
---
# Overview

One of the goals of the Thousand Brains Project is to create a new form of AI that benefits the world **to the greatest extent possible**. To accomplish this goal of broad adoption, we have chosen a **permissive license** and **non-assertion pledge** that covers our patents. These two actions, we believe, will encourage researchers, universities, the private sector, and industry specialists to help accelerate our community's progress in building impressive new capabilities to serve the world.

# üõ°Ô∏è License

We have chosen the standard [MIT License](?tab=t.0#heading=h.ig6u0qlhn2b4). This permissive license places few restrictions on reuse and permits commercial use. It is simple, concise, and compatible with many other licenses.

# ‚öñÔ∏è Patent Non-assertion Pledge

Numenta holds several patents that were created as we unraveled the complexities of the human neocortex and how these principles can be applied to machine learning. However, Numenta's non-assertion pledge means we will only assert these patents defensively to protect the open-source community.  You are free to use all of the technology in the open-source project to create value without worrying about Numenta's patents.

# Appendix

## Non-assertion pledge

1. Numenta, Inc. will not enforce the listed patents against any party, provided that the party or its affiliates do not assert or profit from assertion of any patents against Numenta, Inc., its affiliates or its licensees.  
2. In the event that the party initiates a patent infringement lawsuit against Numenta, Inc., its affiliates or its licensees, Numenta, Inc. reserves the right to pursue all available legal remedies, including but not limited to, asserting counterclaims and defenses, based on the listed patents.  
3. This pledge grants no warranties of any kind, either express or implied, as to the patents, and all such warranties are expressly disclaimed.  
4. This pledge shall be governed by and construed under the laws of California.
