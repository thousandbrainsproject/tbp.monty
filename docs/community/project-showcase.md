## Monty for Object Detection with the iPad Camera
This is the first real-world demo of Monty the TBP team came up with. We used the iPad camera to take an image of an object. Monty then moves a small patch over this image and tries to recognize the object.

See the [monty_lab project folder](https://github.com/thousandbrainsproject/monty_lab/tree/main/monty_meets_world) for more details.

TODO OSS: link you YouTube video of the first demo.
