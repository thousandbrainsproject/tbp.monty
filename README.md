# Welcome to the Monty repository!
*An open-source, sensorimotor learning system following the principles of the neocortex.*

[![](https://github.com/thousandbrainsproject/tbp.monty/actions/workflows/monty.yml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/thousandbrainsproject/tbp.monty/actions/workflows/monty.yml)

This repository contains the first implementation of a **sensorimotor learning system** from the **Thousand Brains Project at Numenta**. We lovingly call it **Monty** after Vernon Mountcastle, who proposed cortical columns as a repeating functional unit across the neocortex.

This is an open-source project by Numenta, partially funded by the Gates Foundation.

Please find our [**full documentation** here](https://thousandbrainsproject.readme.io/)

# Getting Started

You can find detailed instructions on how to install the project requirements and how to get started [here](https://thousandbrainsproject.readme.io/docs/getting-started)

# Current Performance
We regularly evaluate this system against a set of sensorimotor tasks, summarized in the **[benchmark experiments](./benchmarks/configs/)**. Any time a functional change is made to the code, these experiments are rerun, and results are updated.

You can find our current performance on these benchmarks as well as an explanation of them [here](https://thousandbrainsproject.readme.io/docs/benchmark-experiments).
