# Summary
This RFC proposes a mechanism for efficient model-free saccades to be used by the distant agent.

# Motivation
There are two primary motivations
 1. Efficiency: We would like to reduce the number of inference steps required by the distant agent.
 2. Multi-Object Scenes and Compositional Objects: We would like to control the range of saccades to either keep sensors on an object or more sensors to a different objects.

# Approach

# Unresolved questions

# Future possibilities
