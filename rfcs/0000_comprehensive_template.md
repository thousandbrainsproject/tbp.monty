NOTE: While this RFC process is document-based, you are encouraged to also include visual media to help convey your ideas.

# Summary

> A brief explanation of the feature.

# Motivation

> Why are we doing this? What use cases does it support? What is the expected outcome? Which metrics will this improve? What capabilities will it add?
>
> Please focus on explaining the motivation so that if this RFC is not accepted, the motivation could be used to develop alternative solutions. In other words, enumerate the constraints you are trying to solve without coupling them too closely to the solution you have in mind.

# Guide-level explanation

> Explain the proposal as if it was already included in Monty and you were teaching it to another Monty user. That generally means:
>
> - Introducing new named concepts.
> - Explaining the feature largely in terms of examples.
> - Explaining how Monty developers should *think* about the feature and how it should impact the way they use Monty. It should explain the impact as concretely as possible.
> - If applicable, provide sample error messages, deprecation warnings, or migration guidance.
> - If applicable, describe the differences between teaching this to existing Monty users and new Monty users.
> - If applicable, include pictures or other media if possible to visualize the idea.
> - If applicable, provide pseudo plots (even if hand-drawn) showing the intended impact on performance (e.g., the model converges quicker, accuracy is better, etc.).
> - Discuss how this impacts the ability to read, understand, and maintain Monty code. Code is read and modified far more often than written; will the proposed feature make code easier to maintain?
>
> Keep in mind that it may be appropriate to defer some details to the [Reference-level explanation](#reference-level-explanation) section. 
>
> For implementation-oriented RFCs, this section should focus on how developer contributors should think about the change and give examples of its concrete impact. For administrative RFCs, this section should provide an example-driven introduction to the policy and explain its impact in concrete terms.

# Reference-level explanation

> This is the technical portion of the RFC. Explain the design in sufficient detail that:
>
> - Its interaction with other features is clear.
> - It is reasonably clear how the feature would be implemented.
> - Corner cases are dissected by example.
>
> The section should return to the examples from the previous section and explain more fully how the detailed proposal makes those examples work.

# Drawbacks

> Why should we *not* do this? Please consider:
>
> - Implementation cost, both in terms of code size and complexity
> - Whether the proposed feature can be implemented outside of Monty
> - The impact on teaching people Monty
> - Integration of this feature with other existing and planned features
> - The cost of migrating existing Monty users (is it a breaking change?)
>
> There are tradeoffs to choosing any path. Please attempt to identify them here.

# Rationale and alternatives

> - Why is this design the best in the space of possible designs?
> - What other designs have been considered, and what is the rationale for not choosing them?
> - What is the impact of not doing this?

# Prior art and references

> Discuss prior art, both the good and the bad, in relation to this proposal.
> A few examples of what this can include are:
>
> - References
> - Does this functionality exist in other frameworks, and what experience has their community had?
> - Papers: Are there any published papers or great posts that discuss this? If you have some relevant papers to refer to, this can serve as a more detailed theoretical background.
> - Is this done by some other community and what were their experiences with it?
> - What lessons can we learn from what other communities have done here?
>
> This section is intended to encourage you as an author to think about the lessons from other frameworks and provide readers of your RFC with a fuller picture.
> If there is no prior art, that is fine. Your ideas are interesting to us, whether they are brand new or adaptations from other places.
>
> Note that while precedent set by other frameworks is some motivation, it does not on its own motivate an RFC.
> Please consider that Monty sometimes intentionally diverges from common approaches.

# Unresolved questions

> Optional, but suggested for first drafts.
>
> What parts of the design are still TBD?

# Future possibilities

> Optional.
>
> Think about what the natural extension and evolution of your proposal would
> be and how it would affect Monty and the Thousand Brains Project as a whole in a holistic way.
> Try to use this section as a tool to more fully consider all possible
> interactions with the Thousand Brains Project and Monty in your proposal.
> Also consider how this all fits into the future of Monty.
>
> This is also a good place to "dump ideas" if they are out of the scope of the
> RFC you are writing but otherwise related.
>
> If you have tried and cannot think of any future possibilities,
> you may simply state that you cannot think of anything.
>
> Note that having something written down in the future-possibilities section
> is not a reason to accept the current or a future RFC; such notes should be
> in the section on motivation or rationale in this or subsequent RFCs.
> The section merely provides additional information.
