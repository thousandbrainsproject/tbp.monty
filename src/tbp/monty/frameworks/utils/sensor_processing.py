    """Estimate surface normal.

    This is a very simplified alternative to open3d's estimate_normals where we
    make use of several assumptions specific to our case:
    - we know which locations are neighboring locations from the camera patch
      arrangement
    - we only need the surface normal at the center of the patch

    TODO: Calculate surface normal from multiple points at different distances (tan_len
          values) and then take the average of them. Test if this improves robustness
          to raw sensor noise.

    Args:
        point_cloud: list of 3d coordinates and whether the points are on the
            object or not. shape = [n, 4]
        patch_radius_frac: Fraction of observation size to use for SN calculation.
            Default of 2.5 means that we look half_obs_dim//2.5 to the left, right, up
            and down. With a resolution of 64x64 that would be 12 pixels. The
            calculated tan_len (in this example 12) describes the distance of pixels
            used to span up the two tangent vectors to calculate the surface normals.
            These two vectors are then used to calculate the surface normal by taking
            the cross product. If we set tan_len to a larger value the surface normal
            is more influenced by the global shape of the patch.
