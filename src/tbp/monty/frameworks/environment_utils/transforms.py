        """Apply the depth-to-3D-locations transform to sensor observations.

        Applies spatial transforms to the observations and generates a mask used
        to determine which pixels are the object's surface. This modifies the
        observations in-place. Some items may be modified, such as depth values,
        while other values are added (see Returns section).

        In the first part of this function, we build a mask that indicates
        not only which part of the image is on-object, but also which part of
        the image is "on-surface". The distinction between on-object and
        on-surface arises from the fact that the field of view may contain parts
        of the object that are far away from each other. For example, we may
        be looking at the front lip of a mug, but the back lip of the mug is
        also in the field of view. When we compute surface point normals or
        surface curvature for the front lip of the mug, we don't want to include
        pixels from the back lip of the mug.

        To do this, we first need a semantic map that indicates only whether
        the pixel is on- or off-object. We then analyze the depth data to
        determine whether the pixels in the field of view appear to belong to the
        same part of the object (see `get_surface_from_depth` for details). The
        intersection of these two maps forms the on-surface mask (called
        `semantic_obs`) that is embedded into the observation dict and is used
        later when performing point-normal and curvature estimation.

        How we decide to build these masks is dependent on several factors,
        such as whether we are using a distant agent or a surface agent, and
        whether a ground-truth semantic map should be used. This necessitates
        a few different code paths. Here is a brief outline of the parameters
        that reflect these factors as they are commonly used in Monty:
         - when using a surface agent, self.depth_clip_sensors is a non-empty
           tuple. More specifically, we know which sensor is the surface agent
           since it's index will be in self.depth_clip_sensors. We only apply
           depth clipping to the surface agent.
         - surface agents also have their depth and semantic data clipped to a
           a very short range from the sensor. This is done to more closely model
           a finger which has short reach.
         - `use_semantic_sensor` is currently only used with multi-object
           experiments, and when this is `True`, the observation dict will have
           an item called "semantic". In the future, we would like to include
           semantic estimation for multi-object experiments. But until then, we
           continue to support use of the semantic sensor for multi-object
           experiments.
         - When two parts of an object are visible, we separate the two parts
           according to depth. However, the threshold we use to separate the two
           parts is dependent on distant vs surface agents. The parameter
           `default_on_surface_th` changes based on whether we are using a distant
           or surface agent.

        After the mask is generated, we unproject the 2D camera coordinates into
        3D coordinates relative to the agent. We then add the transformed observations
        to the original observations dict.

        Args:
            observations (dict): Observations returned by the data loader.
            state (State, optional): Optionally supplied CMP-compliant state object.

        Returns:
            dict: The original observations dict with the following possibly added:
                - "semantic_3d": 3D coordinates for each pixel. If `self.world_coord`
                    is `True` (default), then the coordinates are in the world's
                    reference frame and are in the sensor's reference frame otherwise.
                    It is structured as a 2D array with shape (n_pixels, 4) with
                    columns containing x-, y-, z-coordinates, and a semantic ID.
                - "world_camera": Sensor-to-world coordinate frame transform. Included
                    only when `self.world_coord` is `True` (default).
                - "sensor_frame_data": 3D coordinates for each pixel relative to the
                    sensor. Has the same structure as "semantic_3d". Included only
                    when `self.get_all_points` is `True`.

        """Return surface patch information from heuristics on depth patch.

        This function returns a binary mask indicating whether each pixel is
        "on-surface" using heuristics on the depth patch and the semantic mask.
        When we say "on-surface", we mean "on the part of the object that the sensor
        is centered on". For example, the sensor may be looking directly at the front
        lip of a mug, but the back lip of the mug is also in view. While both parts
        of the mug are on-object, we only want to use the front lip of the mug for
        later computation (such as point-normal extraction and curvature estimation),
        and so we want to mask out the back lip of the mug.

        Continuing with the the mug front/back lip example, we separate the front
        and back lips by their depth data. When we generate a histogram of pixel
        depths, we should see two distincts peaks of the histogram (or 3 peaks if there
        is a part of the field of view that is off-object entirely). We would then
        compute which depth threshold separates the two peaks that correspond to the
        two surfaces, and this is performed by `get_on_surface_th`. This function
        uses that value to mask out the pixels that are beyond that threshold. Finally,
        we element-wise multiply this surface mask by the semantic (i.e., object mask)
        mask which ensures that off-object observations are also masked out.

        Note that we most often don't have multiple surfaces in view. For example,
        when exploring a mug, we are most often looking direclty at one locally
        connected part of the mug, such as a patch on the mug's cylindrical body.
        In this case, we don't attempt to find a surface-separating threshold, and we
        instead use the default threshold `default_on_surface_th`. As with a
        computed threshold, anything beyond it is zeroed out. For surface agents,
        this threshold is usually quite small (e.g., 5 cm). For distant agents, the
        threshold is large (e.g., 1000 meters) which is functionally infinite.
