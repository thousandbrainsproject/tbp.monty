        Calculates the overlap between the SDR features stored at every location in
        the graph and the query SDR feature. This overlap is then compared to the
        tolerance value and the result is used for adjusting the evidence score.

        We use the tolerance (in overlap bits) for generalization. If two objects are
        close enough, their overlap in bits should be higher that the set tolerance
        value.

        The tolerance sets the lowest overlap for adding evidence, the range
        [tolerance, sdr_on_bits] is mapped to [0,1] evidence points. Any overlap less
        then tolerance will not add any evidence. These evidence scores are then
        multiplied by the feature weight of object_ids which scales all of the
        evidence points to the range [0, channel_feature_weights["object_id"]].
