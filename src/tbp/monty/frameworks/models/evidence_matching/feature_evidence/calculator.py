        """Calculate the feature evidence for all nodes stored in a graph.

        Evidence for each feature depends on the difference between observed and stored
        features, feature weights, and distance weights.

        Evidence is a float between 0 and 1. An evidence of 1 is a perfect match, the
        larger the difference between observed and sensed features, the close to 0 goes
        the evidence. Evidence is 0 if the difference is >= the tolerance for this
        feature.

        If a node does not store a given feature, evidence will be nan.

        input_channel indicates where the sensed features are coming from and thereby
        tells this function to which features in the graph they need to be compared.

        Returns:
            The feature evidence for all nodes.
