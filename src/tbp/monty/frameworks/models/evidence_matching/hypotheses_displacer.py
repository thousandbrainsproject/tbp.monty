            max_match_distance: Maximum distance of a tested and stored location
                to be matched.
            tolerances: How much can each observed feature deviate from the
                stored features to still be considered a match.
            use_features_for_matching: Dictionary mapping input channels to
                booleans indicating whether to use features for matching.
            feature_evidence_calculator: Class to calculate feature evidence for all
                nodes. Defaults to the default calculator.
            feature_evidence_increment: Feature evidence (between 0 and 1) is
                multiplied by this value before being added to the overall evidence of
                a hypothesis. This factor is only multiplied with the feature evidence
                (not the pose evidence as opposed to the present_weight). Defaults to 1.
            max_nneighbors: Maximum number of nearest neighbors to consider in the
                radius of a hypothesis for calculating the evidence. Defaults to 3.
            past_weight: How much should the evidence accumulated so far be
                weighted when combined with the evidence from the most recent
                observation. Defaults to 1.
            present_weight: How much should the current evidence be weighted
                when added to the previous evidence. If past_weight and present_weight
                add up to 1, the evidence is bounded and can't grow infinitely. Defaults

                efficient policy and better parameters that may be possible to use
