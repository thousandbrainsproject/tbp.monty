class ResamplingHypothesesUpdater:
    """Hypotheses updater that resamples hypotheses at every step.

    This updater enables updating of the hypothesis space by resampling and rebuilding
    the hypothesis space at every step. We resample hypotheses from the existing
    hypothesis space, as well as new hypotheses informed by the sensed pose.

    The resampling process is governed by two main parameters:
      - `hypotheses_count_multiplier`: scales the total number of hypotheses every step.
      - `hypotheses_existing_to_new_ratio`: controls the proportion of existing vs.
          informed hypotheses during resampling.

    To reproduce the behavior of `DefaultHypothesesUpdater` sampling a fixed number of
    hypotheses only at the beginning of the episode, you can set
    `hypotheses_count_multiplier=1.0` and `hypotheses_existing_to_new_ratio=0.0`.

        Args:
            feature_weights (dict): How much should each feature be weighted when
                calculating the evidence update for hypothesis. Weights are stored in a
                dictionary with keys corresponding to features (same as keys in
                tolerances).
            graph_memory (EvidenceGraphMemory): The graph memory to read graphs from.
            max_match_distance (float): Maximum distance of a tested and stored location
                to be matched.
            tolerances (dict): How much can each observed feature deviate from the
                stored features to still be considered a match.
            feature_evidence_calculator (Type[FeatureEvidenceCalculator]): Class to
                calculate feature evidence for all nodes. Defaults to the default
                calculator.
            feature_evidence_increment (int): Feature evidence (between 0 and 1) is
                multiplied by this value before being added to the overall evidence of
                a hypothesis. This factor is only multiplied with the feature evidence
                (not the pose evidence as opposed to the present_weight). Defaults to 1.
            features_for_matching_selector (Type[FeaturesForMatchingSelector]): Class to
                select if features should be used for matching. Defaults to the default
                selector.
            hypotheses_count_multiplier (float): Scales the total number of hypotheses
                every step. Defaults to 1.0.
            hypotheses_existing_to_new_ratio (float): Controls the proportion of the
                existing vs. newly sampled hypotheses during resampling. Defaults to
                0.0.
            initial_possible_poses ("uniform" | "informed" | list[Rotation]): Initial
                possible poses that should be tested for. Defaults to "informed".
            max_nneighbors (int): Maximum number of nearest neighbors to consider in the
                radius of a hypothesis for calculating the evidence. Defaults to 3.
            past_weight (float): How much should the evidence accumulated so far be
                weighted when combined with the evidence from the most recent
                observation. Defaults to 1.
            present_weight (float): How much should the current evidence be weighted
                when added to the previous evidence. If past_weight and present_weight
                add up to 1, the evidence is bounded and can't grow infinitely. Defaults
                to 1.
                NOTE: right now this doesn't give as good performance as with unbounded
                evidence since we don't keep a full history of what we saw. With a more
                efficient policy and better parameters that may be possible to use
                though and could help when moving from one object to another and to
                generally make setting thresholds etc. more intuitive.
            umbilical_num_poses (int): Number of sampled rotations in the direction of
                the plane perpendicular to the point normal. These are sampled at
                umbilical points (i.e., points where PC directions are undefined).
            x_percent_threshold: Used in two places:
                1) All objects whose highest evidence is greater than the most likely
                    objects evidence - x_percent of the most like objects evidence are
                    considered possible matches. That means to only have one possible
                    match, no other object can have more evidence than the candidate
                    match's evidence - x percent of it.
                2) Within one object, possible poses are considered possible if their
                    evidence is larger than the most likely pose of this object
                    - x percent of this poses evidence.
                # TODO: should we use a separate threshold for within and between
                objects? If this value is larger, the model is usually more robust to
                noise and reaches a better performance but also requires a lot more
                steps to reach a terminal condition, especially if there are many
                similar object in the data set.
            evidence_update_threshold (float | str): How to decide which hypotheses
                should be updated. When this parameter is either '[int]%' or
                'x_percent_threshold', then this parameter is applied to the evidence
                for the Most Likely Hypothesis (MLH) to determine a minimum evidence
                threshold in order for other hypotheses to be updated. Any hypotheses
                falling below the resulting evidence threshold do not get updated. The
                other options set a fixed threshold that does not take MLH evidence into
                account. In [int, float, '[int]%', 'mean', 'median', 'all',
                'x_percent_threshold']. Defaults to 'all'.

        """Samples the specified number of fully informed hypotheses.

        This method selects hypotheses that are most likely to be informative based on
        feature evidence. Specifically, it identifies the top-k nodes with the highest
        evidence scores and samples hypotheses only from those nodes, making the process
        more efficient than uniformly sampling from all graph nodes.

        The sampling includes:
          - Selecting the top-k node indices based on evidence scores, where k is
             determined by the `informed_count` and the number of hypotheses per node.
          - Fetching the 3D locations of only the selected top-k nodes.
          - Generating rotations for each hypothesis using one of two strategies:
            (a) If `initial_possible_poses` is set, rotations are uniformly sampled or
                user-defined.
            (b) Otherwise, alignments are computed between stored node poses and
                sensed directions.

        This targeted sampling improves efficiency by avoiding unnecessary computation
        for nodes with low evidence, especially beneficial when informed sampling occurs
        at every step.

        Args:
            channel_features (dict): Input channel features.
            informed_count (int): Number of fully informed hypotheses to sample.

            input_channel (str): The channel for which to sample informed hypotheses.
